# change-ip-address

Python script that can be used to change and revert the IP address of  the Wireless Adapter of your PC.

Why did i made such a script?

We used to play a game which goes by the name "Blur" on a daily basis on LAN. And to play this over our LAN, we need to changed the IP address of my Wireless adapter to 192.168.8.XXX. So, in order to avoid the mundane task of everytime opening the wireless adapter settings and then changing the IP configuration, I thought of automating this task. So i wrote a script in python which changes the IP address of the Wireless adapter and wrapped it inside a batch file. Now I am just a double-click away from changing the IP configuration of my Wireless Adapter. I also added a scipt which will revert the Wireless configuration to its default settings.
